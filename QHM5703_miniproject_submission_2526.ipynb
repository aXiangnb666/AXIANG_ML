    "\n",
    "## What is the problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "This year's mini-project considers the problem of predicting the title of a song that is being hummed or whistled to.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will build a machine learning model that takes as an input an audio recording of **10 seconds** of duration. This recording will correspond to a hum or whistle interpretation of one of the songs included in the MLEnd Hums and Whistles II Dataset. The output of the model will be the song label.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Which dataset will I use?\n",
    "\n",
    "We have created two subsets of the Hums and Whistles II Dataset. The first one has 400 samples (\\~1 GB). The second one has 800 samples (\\~2 GB), including those already available in the first dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can download them from:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://github.com/thekmannn/MLEndHW_QHM5703_Sample/raw/main/MLEndHWII_sample_400.zip\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What will I submit?\n",
    "\n",
    "Your submission will consist of **one single Jupyter notebook** that should include:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Text cells**, describing in your own words, rigorously and concisely your approach, each implemented step and the results that you obtain,\n",
    "*   **Code cells**, implementing each step,\n",
    "*   **Output cells**, i.e. the output from each code cell,\n",
    "\n",
    "Your notebook **should have the structure** outlined below. Please make sure that you **run all the cells** and that the **output cells are saved** before submission.\n",

    "* QHM5703_miniproject_2526.ipynb\n",
    "\n",

    "## How will my submission be evaluated?\n",
    "\n",
    "**This submission is worth 20 marks. We will value**:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Conciseness in your writing.\n",
    "*   Correctness in your methodology.\n",
    "*   Correctness in your analysis and conclusions.\n",
    "*   Completeness.\n",
    "*   Originality and efforts to try something new.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The final performance of your solutions will not influence your grade**. We will grade your understanding. If you have a good understanding, you will be using the right methodology, selecting the right approaches and assessing correctly the quality of your solutions, acknowledge where appropriate that despite your attempts your solutions might not good enough, and always critically reflect on your work to suggest what you could have done differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that **the problem that we are intending to solve is very difficult**. Do not despair if you do not get good results, **difficulty is precisely what makes it interesting** and **worth trying**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Show the world what you can do\n",
    "\n",
    "Why don't you use **GitHub** to manage your project? GitHub can be used as a presentation card that showcases what you have done and gives evidence of your data science skills, knowledge and experience. **Potential employers are always looking for this kind of evidence**. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adding your work to MLEndDatasets Gallery\n",
    "If you have worked on your project very well and you feel proud of it, do contact us, we will try to include your work on Gallery of MLEndDatasets website (https://MLEndDatasets.github.io). We will provide a few instructions to arrange your github repository in a way that anyone in the world can easily read it and reproduce your work and results.\n",

    "* After what was mentioned above, I went to make some attempts, but the accuracy ended up being even lower（as the SECOND ATTEMPT）. I think the accuracy decreases after adding stratify=y. The key point is that stratified sampling keeps the test set balanced across the 8 categories of songs, exposing the limitations in distinguishing features of 4 categories and the actual shortcomings in model adaptability, rather than the performance drop being caused by stratified sampling itself. The 0.25 accuracy without stratification is just a 'luck factor' due to the test set containing many easily classified samples.\n",
    "* I believe that by expanding the feature set (adding spectral centroid and rhythm features), the accuracy will improve significantly. All the AI-related content in this article was added after my learning and practice, including some translations, because my grammar is poor. "

    "* From the SVM confusion matrix, I found it mixed up more songs than Random Forest. For example, most wrong guesses for \"TryEverything\" were predicted as \"Friend\", and about half of the \"Necessities\" samples were guessed as \"Happy\". This is similar to RF but even more serious. I think this is because these songs have similar pitch ranges, and SVM is more sensitive to the \"noise\" in my simple features.\n"
